    <h1>digitale, Freakend Developer</h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <img src="images/avatar.png" alt="My avatar">
    <p>qq, my real name is Nikolay, and I'm a big fan of programming, CS, pentesting and even gamedev. I <b>really</b> love tinkering low-level concepts of what I'm working with, and it's mainly programming and computers. So this is where comes my passion about reverse-engineering, low-level languages, pentest and computer architecture.</p>
    <h4>Skills: Python, FastAPI, SQL, SQLModel, Git, HTML, CSS</h4>
    <h4>What is not connected to main job: C, Bash, GDScript, Godot and starting at the moment in Web-Pentesting, Reverse-Engineering and Assembly =)</h4>
    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, at the moment the only project I really have is <a href="https://github.com/d1gitale/HTTP-server">HTTP server</a> made by following <a href="https://codecrafters.io/">CodeCrafters</a> tutorial and a static <a href="https://github.com/d1gitale/Pied_Piper">Pied Piper webpage</a> made also at some course. But soon this list will be expanded by this page and some other projects ^-^</p>
